# Introduction

- Movies entertain us always and we would always want to watch only movies that are rated top and are very popular amongst the   masses.
- The main Objective of this code is to scrape the Top 10 films of the week in the Box Office of the USA.
- The End user can use this code to obtain various information about the movie such as:
    - The Name of the Film.
    - The Year of Release and Certifcate provided by CBFC.
    - The Director of the film.
    - The Star and Overall Rating for the film.
    - The Genre that the film belongs to.
    - The Gross Collection for the film worldwide

# Technologies Used

- Python is used to Scrape the Web Information.
- The Requests Library in python is used to get the contents of the webpage.
- The BeautifulSoup Library in Python is used to parse the contents as an HTML file

# Launch

- The requests library need to be installed in our local PC before the launch of this project.
- Install the library by the command [!pip install requests --upgrade --quiet]
- Install BeautifulSoup Library by the command [!pip install beautifulsoup4 --upgrade --quiet]

# Scope Of Functionalities

- The Knowledge of Web Scraping can help us obtain any dynamic information from the website at any point of time
  without actually checking the website manually but by just running a piece of code.
- Use Cases like Machine and Deep learning Models often require Data to be Scraped form the Internet and not any Static Data.
- With the help of the Data Scraped from the IMDb website, one can build his/her own **Movie Recommendation System**

# Conclusion

- The Information form the web is scraped successfully and is stored as a CSV file in the local Repository.
- This Project reallly helped me understand and get a hold with the basics of python and Webscraping.
